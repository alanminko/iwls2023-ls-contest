## Problems and Results of IWLS 2023 Programming Contest

This repository contains the benchmarks of [IWLS 2023](https://www.iwls.org/iwls2023/program.php) 
Programming Contest and the circuits produced by the participants in response to the challenge.  

The goal of the contest was to synthesize [AIGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph) 
with the minimal number of two-input and-nodes (AIGs) and two-input xor-and-nodes (XAIGs), 
for a set of completely-specified multi-output Boolean functions 
represented using truth tables. The AIGs and XAIGs had to be submited in [binary AIGER format](http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/).
For the detailed information about the rules and evaluation criteria, please refer to the 
[contest description](https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2023-ls-contest/blob/main/IWLS_2023_Programming_Contest.pdf).

The contest was organized by Alan Mishchenko and Yukio Miyasaka (IWLS 2023 Contest Chairs) 
with active support from Cunxi Yu (IWLS 2023 General Chair) as well as Xiaoqing Xu and Lana Josipovic 
(IWLS 2023 Program Chairs).
